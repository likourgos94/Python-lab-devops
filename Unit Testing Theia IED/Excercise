Here is a function that accepts two arguments and returns their sum.

Copy and paste the below code into mymodule.py and the save the file.

def add(a,b):
    """
    This function returns the sum of the given numbers
    """
    return a + b


Write test cases for these scenarios. * When 2 and 4 are given as input the output must be 4. * When 0 and 0 are given as input the output must be 0. * When 2.3 and 3.6 are given as input the output must be 5.9. * When the strings 'hello' and 'world' are given as input the output must be 'helloworld'. * When 2.3000 and 4.300 are given as input the output must be 6.6. * When -2 and -2 are given as input the output must **not** be 0. (Hint : Use assertNotEqual)

To check if correct, use "python3 test_mymodule.py" on terminal
